Sprite is a fictional game development application. It is created as one of my personal projects at thoughtbot. The goals of the project are to practice logo/icon design and responsive mobile design for a product website.

A game development application is usually a desktop application around a framework using a specific language to write games. It allows developers to easily track levels, characters, scripts and other game assets.

I'd like the site to be easy for anyone to come to the website and quickly be able to:
* Purchase the app
* Download a trial of the app
* Find out exactly what the app can do
