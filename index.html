    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>Sprite offers many time saving, easy to use, features to keep you developing. Here are a few:</p>
    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Pick your language</h3>
      <p>Just staring out? You can use Ruby to get most of your game up and running. Need more power? Objective-C (and just plain C) is under the hood for you to use. At the end of the process, everything get's transformed into C for raw power.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Consolidated Testing</h3>
      <p>Need to test your game? Of course you do. You can run your game directly in the app to get a sense of how it plays immediately. We think it's simply the best way to create quiality games.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Integrated Graphics Editor</h3>
      <p>What game would be complete without graphics? Unless you're creating the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork" target="_blank">Zork</a> great grapics are paramount. We've provided an editor for keyframe animation, scene creation, paralax scrolling scenes and more.</p>

    <h2>By Developers, For Developers</h2>
    <p>
      We wanted to develop games, but there wasn't anything that met our standards. Every other tool out there was clunky, ugly and a pain to use. That's why we created Sprite. Our goal is to keep you from fighting with your IDE and get you developing.
