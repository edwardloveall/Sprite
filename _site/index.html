          No matter if you're a hardcore C++ developer, or just an scripter, we have a language for you. You can code your core app in Obj-C and write your scripts in Lua. Or you can write your app in Ruby and use OpenGL for all your graphics. It doesn't matter. We support and have syntax hilighting for all the languages you see to the right. It gets better, we compile everything down into C code to run on any platform.

      <h2>Frequetly Asked Questions</h2>
      <section class="question">
        <h3>Can I run Sprite on Windows?</h3>
        <p>Not at the moment. We have faith that Microsoft can get their act together, but for now, we can't provide a solid platform for development.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="question">
        <h3>Do you have group Pricing?</h3>
        <p>Yes! If you have a team of 5 or more people, get in touch.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="question">
        <h3>Do I to lisence anything to release a game with your tools?</h3>
        <p>Ncot at all. All you need to do is purchase the app and you can release whatever you want.</p>

      <h2>By Developers, For Developers</h2>
      <p>
        We wanted to develop games, but there wasn't anything that met our standards. Every other tool out there was clunky, ugly and a pain to use. That's why we created Sprite. Our goal is to keep you from fighting with your IDE and get you developing.
